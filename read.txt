Participants will work with techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes, key tools in the NLP toolkit.

Human activity recognition using a smartphone dataset and Random Forest introduces the concept of supervised learning with time-series data. Here, participants will use accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify various physical activities. This project showcases the versatility of machine learning in handling complex, real-world data. Following this, sentiment analysis using NLTK allows learners to dive deeper into NLP by determining the sentiment behind text data. This project involves cleaning and tokenizing text, as well as using pre-built sentiment lexicons to analyze emotional undertones in social media posts, reviews, or comments.

Building a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity is another exciting project. Here, participants learn to create collaborative filtering systems, which are essential for personalizing user experiences in applications. By comparing user preferences and suggesting movies similar to what they have previously liked, participants gain insights into how recommendation engines function in popular platforms. Predicting house prices with linear regression then brings the focus back to supervised learning. Using historical data, learners build a model to predict house prices, introducing them to the basics of regression, data cleaning, and feature selection.

Weather forecasting using historical data takes learners through time-series prediction, an essential skill for handling sequential data. Participants will explore different modeling approaches to forecast weather trends. Following this, the bootcamp covers building a basic neural network from scratch. Here, participants write their own implementation of a neural network, learning about the intricacies of forward and backward propagation, weight updates, and optimization techniques. This project offers a hands-on approach to understanding neural networks at a granular level.

The course then progresses to stock price prediction using linear regression. This project teaches learners how to apply predictive modeling techniques to financial data, examining trends and patterns in stock prices. Predicting diabetes using logistic regression covers binary classification, where learners will predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical data. This project emphasizes the importance of healthcare data analytics and gives participants practical experience in building logistic regression models.

The dog vs. cat classifier project with a CNN introduces convolutional neural networks. This is a key project in image classification, as participants work on creating a model that differentiates between images of cats and dogs. With this project, learners gain a practical understanding of how CNNs work for image recognition tasks. Next, the Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the Minimax Algorithm introduces the concept of game theory and decision-making. The AI will learn to play optimally, providing participants with a foundation in developing game AI.
